## Installation ##

You can check the release page of this repository for *.osk* packages which
you can open with Osu.

To manually install Nekobeat from this repository, simply drag and drop the
*nekobeat* directory into your root Osu! *skins* folder. From there on you will
be able to select the skin from the ingame settings menu.

## License ##

This repository is not released under any license since many parts of it have
been taken from other skins and then modified to my personal liking. It has
grown over time and I have failed to write down who I have technically stolen
from.

If you found something you created in this repository please give me a shout
so I can add you to the credits.

However, don't be like me: If you do modify this skin it would be nice to be
credited for the original work. Other than that just have fun and do with it as
you please.
